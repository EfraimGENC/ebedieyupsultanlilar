# Mehmet Âkif Ersoy

Mehmet Âkif Ersoy (20 December 1873 - 27 December 1936) was a Turkish national poet, veterinarian, and politician who authored the lyrics of the Turkish National Anthem (İstiklâl Marşı). He is widely regarded as one of Turkey's most important literary figures and is honored with the titles "Independence Poet" and "National Poet."

## Early Life

Mehmet Âkif Ersoy, originally named Mehmed Ragîf, was born on 20 December 1873 in the Fatih district of Istanbul. His father was İpekli Tahir Efendi from Kosovo, and his mother was Emine Şerife Hanım of Bukhara origin. When he lost his father at age 14 and their house was destroyed in a fire, he had to discontinue his education and start working.

## Education and Career

He enrolled in the Halkalı Agricultural and Veterinary School to become a veterinarian and graduated with honors in 1893. After graduation, he began working as an assistant veterinary inspector at the Ministry of Agriculture. He later taught at various schools and gave literature lectures at Darülfünün (Istanbul University).

## Literary Life and the National Anthem

From 1908 onwards, he served as editor-in-chief of the magazine Sırat-ı Müstakim (later Sebilü'r-Reşad). His poems and articles were published in these magazines. His most important work is the poetry collection "Safahat," published in seven volumes.

His poem, which was accepted as the Turkish National Anthem by the Turkish Grand National Assembly on 12 March 1921, became Turkey's national anthem. Âkif donated the 500-lira prize money he received from the competition to the Red Crescent Society.

## Final Years

Mehmet Âkif moved to Egypt in 1925, where he taught Turkish language and literature in Cairo. Due to cirrhosis, he returned to Istanbul for treatment on 17 June 1936 and passed away on 27 December 1936 at the Mısır Apartment in Beyoğlu. He was buried in Edirnekapı Martyrs' Cemetery.

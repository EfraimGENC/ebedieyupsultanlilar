Mehmet Akif Ersoy is not only the poet of the National Anthem; he is also a thinker who conveyed the conscience of the nation through his verses. His life, which began in Istanbul in 1873, led him on a multifaceted journey from veterinary medicine to teaching, from intellectualism to the political arena.

So, how does a poem become a symbol of a nation's independence? Âkif's pen wrote not only words but also faith and the spirit of struggle. His lines still vividly convey the pains and hopes of an era. The more you learn, the more you encounter a life that invites you to discover this spirit hidden between the lines.

**Gönenli Mehmed Efendi** (Mehmet Öğütçü) is considered one of the most important spiritual figures of the Republic era in Turkey. Born in the Gönen district of Balıkesir and dedicating his life to the service of the Quran, Gönenli Hoca also held the title of Reisü'l-Kurra (chief Quran reciter). He trained hundreds of hafiz (Quran memorizers) and pioneered the opening of Quran courses, especially between 1940 and 1980, during difficult times when Quran education was limited. During his long years as an imam and preacher at the Sultanahmet Mosque, he touched the hearts of thousands of people with his simple and sincere style, becoming a spiritual guide to them.

What made him valuable was not only his profound knowledge, but also his compassion, selflessness, and generosity towards his Quran students and the poor. It is known that he had no pocket of his own and spent all his earnings on his students and those in need. In this respect, he is remembered not only as a scholar but also as a living monument of morality and a man of the heart. Gönenli Mehmed Efendi, who left a deep mark on the spiritual fabric of Istanbul, continues to be remembered with prayers even after his death. His tomb is located in the Eyüpsultan district of Istanbul and is visited by many people.
